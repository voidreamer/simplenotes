# SimpleNotes Roadmap

## Philosophy
Keep it **simple, delightful, and focused**. No feature bloat. Every addition should feel like a natural extension of the core experience.

## What to Avoid
- **Ads** - ruins the premium feel
- **Social features** - it's not a social app
- **AI writing features** - keep it simple
- **Complex permissions** - confusing
- **Notification spam** - respectful defaults

---

## Monetization Philosophy

**Donation-based** works well for apps that:
- Have a passionate niche audience
- Feel handcrafted and personal
- Respect user privacy
- Don't require server-heavy features

### Pay What You Want Model
- Suggested price: $9/year
- Minimum: $0 (fully functional)
- Generous: $29/year (extra themes, supporter badge)

This builds goodwill and often generates more than strict paywalls for indie apps.
